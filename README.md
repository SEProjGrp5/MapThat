Double booking a time-slot is a common mistake that us humans make all the time! We also don't take into account that we are not FLASH and that we need some time to travel from point A to point B. While scheduling appointments on google calendar; the travel time between appointments is not taken into consideration.


We aim to develop a tool which will read the google calendar appointments to determing the location and calculate the average travel time to the appointment from either a predetermined location or the location of the previous appointment and block the time needed on google calendar.

We plan to implement it as a python application which will be connected to the google calendar and google maps. 

We will be using the google calendar and google maps APIs to read and write the calendar entries.

To maintan privacy of users, we will directly store the data in the users account.
