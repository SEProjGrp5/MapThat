# Chrome Extention to add travel time to google calendar
A common issue of scheduling on google calendar is that travel time between appointments are not taken into consideration.
We aim to develop a tool which will read the google calendar appointments to determing the location and calculate the average travel time to the appointment from either a predetermined location or the location of the previous appointment and block the time needed on google calendar.
We plan to implement it as a google chrome extention which will be connected to the google calendar and google maps apis and use them to read and write the calendar entries.
To maintan privacy of users, we will directly store the data in the users account.
